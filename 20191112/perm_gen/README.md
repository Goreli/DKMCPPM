## Introduction

This folder contains source code written to address the String Permutation Generator challenge discussed at the Melbourne C++ Meetup Olympiad on 12/Nov/2019. A program has been written in C++ that solves the challenge. 


## Content Overview

The source code of the solution consists of the following components located in the directory: ... list the content here


## Build Notes

The []() directory contains a Makefile file that builds the project files on the Linux platform. The C++ compiler the source files have been tested with is clang++. Navigate to the []() directory and type "make [Enter]" to build a binary executable file.

Here is a summary of the Makefile targets:

* make all [Enter] - Same as just "make [Enter]" - builds a binary executable and creates an input CSV data file containing 100 data points;

...

Also, there is a respective Visual Studio 2019 project available. Open the dkmccpm.sln solution file located in the root folder of the repository and navigate to this project in the Solution Explorer panel. Here is the project configuration log:
1. Set the language standard to c++17;
2. Let the c++ compiler know the locations of include areas: ../..
3. Switch precompiled headers off;
4. Set the Command Line Arguments in the Debugging section to "Hello World!". Make sure to include the double quoting marks.
