## Introduction

This directory contains C++ source code written to address the String Permutation Generator challenge discussed at the Melbourne C++ Meetup Olympiad on 12/Nov/2019. A reusable C++ template header file has been developed that allows to calculate permutations of arbitrary trivial type sequences. Also, two applications have been developed that specialise the permutation engine specifically for the purpose of string permutation and provide command line interfaces to drive their respective functions.

Application **str-perm-gen-b** has been designed to dry run the permutation engine for benchmarking purposes. Given an input string the appication prints summary level information about how many permutations have been generated, how many test cycles have been executed and what the average execution time per test cycle is.

Application **str-perm-gen** prints actual permutations of the input string specified. It may take long time to print all possible permutations of a long input string. The application accepts a command line argument that limits the number of permutations to generate in order to keep the execution time below a reasonable limit. Also, in cases where it takes long time to print the output on the screen the users should be able to impove performance of the program by redirecting the standard output to a disk file. 

The following image shows example output generated by the applications. The commands executed were:
 * ./str-perm-gen-b "Hello World" 10
 * ./str-perm-gen Car

## Content Overview

The project source code consists of the following components located in the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) directory:
 * perm_gen_base.hpp - declares a template class called PermutationGeneratorBase. The class template provides a generic permutation engine that can process sequences of arbitrary trivial types. Populate *std::vector<T>* with the input sequence and pass it into the *generate(....)* function to start generating permutations of the sequence. Every time the engine generates a new permutation it passes the permutation into the *process_(....)* pure virtual function. Derived classes are responsible for utilising (printing, updating application variables etc) the permutations by overriding the *process_(....)* pure virtual function;
 * perm_gen_base.inl - this module defines the PermutationGeneratorBase template class and is included as a compilation unit at the end of perm_gen_base.hpp. Applications link the permutation engine in by including the perm_gen_base.hpp header file;
 * str_perm_gen_b.cpp - this is the main entry module of the str-perm-gen-b application. It implements a command line interface to the permutation engine adapted to the char data type. The purpose is to benchmark performance of the string permutation process;
 * str_perm_gen.cpp - the main entry module of the str-perm-gen application. It has its own command line interface to the permutation engine adapted to the char data type. The purpose is to provide a command line tool that efficiently delivers string permutations.
  
## Command Line Interface
 
### CLI for str-perm-gen-b
str-perm-gen-b [input_string] [number_of_test_cycles]
 * input_string - the string to generate permutations of;
 * number_of_test_cycles - the number of test cycles to execute before calculating the average duration per cycle.

If there are no command line arguments specified then the application prints its usage instructions.

Example:
./str-perm-gen-b "Hello World" 10

In this example the application executes 10 cycles each generating 39,916,800 permutations. It records the total execution time, divides it by the number of cycles (which is 10) to arrive at the average duration per cycle and prints the result on the screen. Despite the fact that the number of permutations to deal with is huge the duration of the process is noticably short as there is no large volume of information to print.

### CLI for str-perm-gen
str-perm-gen [input_string] [max_num_perm]
 * input_string - the string to generate permutations of;
 * max_num_perm - the maximum number of permutations to generate and output. If this parameter is not specified then the application generates and outputs all possible permutations.

If there are no command line arguments specified then the application prints its usage instructions.

 #### Example 1
./str-perm-gen Car

In this example the application generates all the 6 possible permutations and prints them on the screen.

#### Example 2
./str-perm-gen "Hello, World!" 100

The application only generates 100 out of 6,227,020,800 possible permutations. It prints the 100 permutations on the screen within milliseconds.

#### Example 3
./str-perm-gen "Hi there!" > permuted_greetings.txt

The application generates all the 362,880 possible permutations. It redirects the standard output to the permuted_greetings.txt file to keep the duration under a reasonable limit. Nothing is printed on the screen. The process completes within a few seconds. 

## Build Notes

The project provides build artefacts for two platforms. There is a Makefile in the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) directory that compiles the source code on the Linux platform using the clang++ compiler. There are also Visual Studio 2019 project files in the [vs_projects](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen/vs_projects) subdirectory.

Navigate to the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) directory and type "make [Enter]" to build binary executables on the Linux platform. Type "make test [Enter]" and "make benchmark [Enter]" to test-run the applications. Here is a summary of the Linux Makefile targets:

 * make all [Enter] (same as make [Enter]) - build both applications in the project directory;
 * make str-perm-gen-b [Enter] - build str-perm-gen-b;
 * make str-perm-gen [Enter] - build str-perm-gen;
 * make clean [Enter] - remove both applications from the project directory;
 * make test [Enter] - prints permutations of the string "Car";
 * make benchmark [Enter] - benchmarks the permutation engine using the string "Hello World";
 * make release [Enter] - builds both applications and copies them to the ../../elf/release directory.

To build Windows executables open the dkmccpm.sln solution file located in the root folder of the repository and navigate to this project in the Solution Explorer panel. The actual binaries are created in ../../x64. Here is the project configuration log:
1. Set the language standard to c++17;
2. Let the c++ compiler know the locations of include areas: ../..
3. Switch precompiled headers off;
4. Set the Command Line Arguments in the Debugging section to "Hello World!". Make sure to include the double quoting marks.
