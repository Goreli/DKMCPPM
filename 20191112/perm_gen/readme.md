## Introduction

This directory contains C++ source code that has been written to address the String Permutation Generator challenge discussed at the Melbourne C++ Meetup Olympiad on 12/Nov/2019. At the core of the solution there is a reusable generic template header file that calculates permutations of sequences of arbitrary trivial C++ data types. Two command line applications have been implemented that provide an adaptation of the generic template to work specifically with textual (char) type permutations. In addition, a random permutation generator is available that exposes several algorithms via the command line interface. Also, there is a file bytewise entropy calculator application available that can help assess quality of the random permutation algorithms used. The source code has been tested on the Windows and Ubuntu platforms.

Application **str-perm-gen** generates and prints permutations of an input string specified on the command line. Also, it exposes various convenience functions via respective command line options.

It may take long time to print all possible permutations of a long string. In general the combinatorial nature of the domain is associated with unstable performance whereby a slight increase of the input can cause a disproportionately large increase of the output. The application accepts command line arguments that help limit the number of permutations generated in order to keep performance within acceptable boundaries. A Regular Expressions (regex) syntax based filter is also available. Another way to improve performance is to write the output to a disk file instead of printing it on the screen. 

The application can be executed in a timing mode where it prints performance stats instead of printing permutations generated. This mode helps assess impact of various convenience functions on performance of the application.

Application **str-perm-gen-b** has been designed to accurately benchmark performance of just the core permutation engine excluding any overhead associated with presence of convenience functions. Given an input string the appication prints summary level information about how many permutations have been generated, how many test cycles have been executed and what the average duration is.

The image below shows example output generated by the applications. The following commands were executed:
```
./str-perm-gen-b "Hello World" -t 10
./str-perm-gen Car
```
![alt text](data/example1.png "Example output of str-perm-gen-b and str-perm-gen.")

Application **file-entropy** reads an input file specified on the command line, calculates bytewise entropy of the content and prints the calculated figure. It can optionally print the byte frequency table as well. By default the application works in the text mode that only processes printable bytes (those that, if printed, occupy space on the screen). There is a command line option that turns on the binary mode to process all the content regardless of its printability. This application can be used to assess the quality of the random permutation generator provided with the **str-perm-gen** application.

The image below shows example output generated by the applications. First **str-perm-gen** was executed to create a file containing 40320 randomly generated permutations of the 12345678 sequence. Durstenfeld's random permutation algorithm was used. Next the **file-entropy** application was executed twice: once to calculate the entropy of the dataset in the text mode and the second time to do the calculation in the binary mode. Note how it reported larger content in the second run - this is because of the End-of-Line non-printable characters that were ignored in the first (text mode) run, but were processed in the second (binary mode) run. The following commands were executed:
```
./str-perm-gen 12345678 -c 40320 -r 2 -o rand_12345678.txt
./file-entropy rand_12345678.txt
./file-entropy rand_12345678.txt -b
```

## Content Overview

The project source code consists of the following components located in the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) directory:
 * **perm_gen_base.hpp** - declares a template class called PermutationGeneratorBase. The class template provides a generic permutation generator that can process sequences of arbitrary trivial types. Populate *std::vector<T>* with the input sequence and pass it into the *generate(....)* function to start generating permutations of the sequence. Every time the generator generates a new permutation it passes the permutation into the *process_(....)* pure virtual function. Derived classes are responsible for utilising (printing, updating application variables etc) the permutations by overriding the *process_(....)* pure virtual function;
 * **perm_gen_base.inl** - this module defines the PermutationGeneratorBase template class and is included as a compilation unit at the end of perm_gen_base.hpp. Applications link the permutation generator in by including the perm_gen_base.hpp header file;
 * **cli_parser_base.hpp** - declares a helper class called CLIParserBase. The class provides certain convenience functions for command line applications that require parsing of command line options;
 * **cli_parser_base.cpp** - defines the CLIParserBase class;
 * **str_perm_gen_main.cpp** - the main entry module of the str-perm-gen application. It uses a dedicated command line interface to drive a string type specialisation of the generic permutation generator. The purpose is to provide a command line tool that efficiently delivers string permutations;
 * **str_perm_gen.hpp** - declares the string type specialisation of the permutation generator for the str-perm-gen application;
 * **str_perm_gen.cpp** - defines the string type specialisation of the permutation generator for the str-perm-gen application;
 * **str_perm_gen_cli.hpp** - declares the command line parser class for the str-perm-gen application. Utilises the CLIParserBase base class described above;
 * **str_perm_gen_cli.cpp** - defines the command line parser class for the str-perm-gen application;
 * **str_perm_gen_b.cpp** - this is the main entry (and only) module of the str-perm-gen-b application. It implements a string type specialisation of the generic permutation generator along with a dedicated command line interface. The purpose is to benchmark performance of the string permutation process;
 * **file_entropy.cpp** - this is the main entry (and only) module of the file-entropy application.
  
## Command Line Interface
 
### CLI for str-perm-gen
str-perm-gen [input_string] [options]

The input_string parameter specifies a string to generate permutations of. The following options are supported:
 * **+number** - starts printing at the specified permutation number. The permutation number is a 1 based number, not a 0 based index;
 * **-c count**  - the count of permutations to print;
 * **-e regex**  - excluding regex. Excludes permutations that match the regular expression;
 * **-g size**  - collects the permutations into consecutive groups of the specified size, then randomly picks one permutation from each consecutive group and prints them;
 * **-h**  - prints help information. This option overrides all other options. It allows to quickly request help information without deleting any of the other options that the user may have already typed on the command line;
 * **-i regex**  - including regex. Only prints permutations that match the regular expression;
 * **-l order**    - generates permutations arranged lexicographically in an ascending (literal **a**) or descending (literal **d**) order;
 * **-n** - prints permutation numbers (1 based numbers, not 0 based indices) at the start of each line. By default no permutation numbers are printed;
 * **-o path** - specifies the output file path. By default the output is printed on the screen. If this option is specified then the output is not printed on the screen and is written to the output file instead;
 * **-p order** - pre-sorts the input string in ascending (literal **a**) or descending (literal **d**) order. By default the input string is not pre-sorted;
 * **-r id** - specifies the id of the random permutation algorithm to use. The following algorithms are supported: **1** - default algorithm, **2** - Richard Durstenfeld (modernised Fisher-Yates), **3** - Sandra Sattolo. This option is not compatible with the **-x**. Algorithm **1** stops after generating M! (M factorial) permutations where M is the number of symbols in the input sequence. Algorithms **2** and **3** don't stop generating random permutations unless the user explicitly specifies the maximum count with the **-c count** command line option. Also, the process can be interrupted by pressing the _Ctrl-C_ key combination;
 * **-t repeat**  - times the application. The application follows all directives specified on the command line, but it doesn't actually output any permutations. It just dry-runs the user defined task several times and outputs the average duration. The **repeat** parameter specifies how many times the process should be executed before calculating the average duration. This option has no utility other than performance tuning;
 * **-x**  - excludes duplicate permutations. By default the application generates M! (M factorial) permutations, where M is the number of symbols in the input sequence. If there are duplicate symbols in the input sequence then, by default, the application lets duplicates into the output. However, with the **-x** option specified the application leaves the duplicate permutations out. As an example, by default, the application generates 6 permutations of the _'foo'_ sequence. However, with the **-x** option specified only 3 unique permutations of _'foo'_ are generated. This option is not compatible with the **-r** option.

The **-e** and **-i** options are mutually exclusive. They provide light-weight support for regular expression based filtering and are expected to comply with the ECMAScript standard. The specification of the ECMAScript standard can be found here: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/regex/ECMAScript/.

Note that not all regular expressions can be used interchangeably on the Windows and Linux command lines. This is because the different platforms use different escape characters and, in general, different command line syntax rules. This may cause unexpected behaviour of regular expressions when migrating them between the platforms. Part of the roadmap for this application is to develop a text file based regex filter in order to offer platform independent interpretation of regex expressions. Meanwhile the full power of regex expressions can be applied via the -i and -e command line options as long as they are validated when migrating from one platform to another.

If there are no command line arguments specified then the application prints its usage instructions.

 #### Example 1
    ./str-perm-gen Car

In this example the application prints all the 6 possible permutations of the string Car.

#### Example 2
    ./str-perm-gen Car +3

The application skips the first two permutations. It starts printing beginning with the 3rd permutation and prints 4 permutations in total.

#### Example 3
    ./str-perm-gen Car +3 -c 2

The application skips the first two permutations. It starts printing beginning with the 3rd permutation and prints 2 permutations in total.

#### Example 4
    ./str-perm-gen Car +3 -c 2 -n 

Same as the previous example. The difference is the application prints permutation numbers at the start of each line.

#### Example 5
    ./str-perm-gen "Hi there!" +1300 -c 100 -n > permuted_greetings.txt

The application skips the first 1,299 permutations and starts printing beginning with permutation #1,300. It only prints 100 out of 362,880 possible permutations. Permutation numbers are printed at the start of each line. The output is redirected to the permuted_greetings.txt file, so nothing is actually displayed on the screen and all the output is saved in the disk file. Note that the redirection of standard output to the disk file improves performance of the process.

#### Example 6
    ./str-perm-gen "Hi there!" +1300 -c 100 -n -o permuted_greetings.txt

Similar to example 5. Note the -o option used to specify the output file.

#### Example 7
    ./str-perm-gen "Hello World" -n -i " Hello$"

The inclusion type regex is used. The application only prints permutations that end with " Hello". Permutation numbers are printed at the start of each line.

### CLI for str-perm-gen-b
str-perm-gen-b [input_string] [options]

The input_string parameter specifies a string to generate permutations of. The following options are supported:
 * **-h**  - prints help information. This option overrides all other options. It allows to quickly request help information without deleting any of the other options that the user may have already typed on the command line;
 * **-t repeat**  - dry-runs just the core permutation engine excluding any overhead associated with presence of convenience functions. The repeat parameter specifies how many times the process should be executed before calculating the average duration. Duplicate permutations are allowed. This option has no utility other than performance tuning.

If there are no command line arguments specified then the application prints its usage instructions.

Example:
    ./str-perm-gen-b "Hello World" -t 10

In this example the application executes 10 cycles each generating 39,916,800 permutations. It records the total execution time, divides it by the number of cycles (which is 10) to arrive at the average duration per cycle and prints the result on the screen. Despite the fact that the number of permutations to deal with is huge the duration of the process is noticably short as there is no large volume of information to print.

### CLI for file-entropy
file-entropy [file_path] [options]

The file_path parameter specifies an input file to calculate entropy of. The following options are supported:
 * **-b**  - binary mode. Process non-printable bytes as well as printable ones. By default the application only processes printable bytes (text mode);
 * **-f param**  - prints the constituent byte frequency table as well. Set **param** to a literal **n** to print the constituent bytes in a numeric format. Set **param** to a literal **t** to print the constituent bytes as printable characters. By default the application does not print the frequency table;
 * **-h**  - prints help information. This option overrides all other options. It allows to quickly request help information without deleting any of the other options that the user may have already typed on the command line;
 * **-l base**  - by default the logarithm base used in the calculation equals the count of distinct bytes in the input file. This ensures the entropy value is normalised in the [0, 1] range. The **-l base** command line option allows to specify an alternative value for the logarithm base that helps to rescale entropy accordingly with a particular information measurement unit at use.

In the example below the logarithm base has been explicitly set to a 2 in order to express entropy in 2 based information measurement units (bits). Note that entropy of this random dataset composed of 8 distinct characters equals 3 bits. The following commands were executed:
```
./str-perm-gen 12345678 -c 40320 -r 2 -o rand_12345678.txt
./file-entropy rand_12345678.txt -l 2
```

## Build Notes

The project provides build system artefacts for two platforms. There is a CMakeLists.txt file in the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) directory that can be processed with CMake to create build system artefacts on the Linux platform. There are also Visual Studio 2019 project files in the [vs_projects](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen/vs_projects) subdirectory that build Windows executables.

There is a bash script called cmake-build.sh located in the util directory under the root directory of the repository. This script automates the processing of the CMakeLists.txt file with CMake. Particularly, it accepts the toolchain name and target build type as command line arguments and creates respective subdirectories populated with build system artefacts. The Gnu and Clang toolchains are supported combined with the following build types: Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. Navigate to the [perm_gen](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen) source directory and execute cmake-build.sh with proper command line arguments to create the required build system artefacts. Examples follow.

1. Clang, Release

Navigate to the source directory, create build system artefacts for the Clang compiler to create Release type binaries, then build the binaries.
```
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen$ ../../util/cmake-build.sh Clang Release
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen$ cd ClangRelease
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen/ClangRelease$ make
```

2. Gnu, Debug

Navigate to the source directory, create build system artefacts for the Gnu compiler to create Debug type binaries, then build the binaries.
```
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen$ ../../util/cmake-build.sh Gnu Debug
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen$ cd GnuDebug
/..../dkmcppm/20191112/perm_gen/GnuDebug$ make
```


Here is a summary of Linux Makefile targets supported:

 * make all [Enter] (same as make [Enter]) - build all the three applications in the build subdirectory;
 * make str-perm-gen [Enter] - build str-perm-gen;
 * make str-perm-gen-b [Enter] - build str-perm-gen-b;
 * make file-entropy [Enter] - build file-entropy;
 * make clean [Enter] - remove all the three applications from the project directory;
 * make permutations [Enter] - tests str-perm-gen by printing 10 permutations of "Hello World";
 * make benchmark [Enter] - benchmarks the permutation generator by feeding the string "Hello World" into str-perm-gen-b;
 * make entropy [Enter] - generates 10 random permutations of "Hello World" and calculates entropy of the dataset generated.

To build Windows executables open the dkmccpm.sln solution file located in the root directory of the repository and navigate to this project in the VS 2019 Solution Explorer panel. The actual binaries are created in ../../x64.

Alternatively, add the project file(s) located in the [vs_projects](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/perm_gen/vs_projects) subdirectory to your existing VS 2019 solution.

Here is the Visual Studio project configuration log:
1. Set the language standard to c++17;
2. Let the c++ compiler know the locations of include areas: ../..
3. Switch precompiled headers off;
4. Set the Command Line Arguments in the Debugging section to "Hello World". Make sure to include the double quoting marks.

## Roadmap

1. Develop a text file based regex filter in order to offer platform independent interpretation of regex expressions as well as an advanced filtering facility. In this application performance bottleneck is caused by the output stream, so it should be possible to manage the regex overhead by taking a multithreading based approach;
2. Explore ways to use concurrency or async (or plain C io) to boost performance of the output stream (refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21126950/asynchronously-writing-to-a-file-in-c-unix);
3. Dynamically linked installable random permutation providers.
