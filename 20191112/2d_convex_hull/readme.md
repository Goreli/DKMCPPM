## Introduction

This folder contains source code written to address the 2D Convex Hull challenge published on the Wiki page of the Melbourne C++ Meetup Olimpiad repo: https://github.com/melbourne-cpp/olympiad/wiki. A program has been written in C++ that solves the challenge. Also, a chart has been created using the output of the program that demonstrates a geometric relationship between the input and output datasets. The image below shows how the output of the program forms a 2D convex hull that encompasses the input dataset.

## Content Overview

The source code of the solution consists of the following components located in the [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory:

* [ch2d-main.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d-main.cpp) - the entry module of the C++ program. The program does not parse the command line and expects an input file with a name hardcoded as "inp-file.csv". Example input files can be found in the [data](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/data) subdirectory;
* [ch2d-alg.hpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d-alg.hpp) and [ch2d-alg.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d-alg.cpp) - these are the main modules that define the solution logic at a high level;
* [ch2d-data-point.hpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d-data-point.hpp) and [ch2d-data-point.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d-data-point.cpp) - an implementation of a 2D geometric point class that provides certain useful functionality utilised in the solution logic module.


The [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory also contains a Linux shell script called gen-inp-file.sh that generates input files containing random data for the solution. The x and y values generated by the script vary in the [-1.0, +1.0] range. The script depends on presence of awk. Refer the content of Makefile to see example command line syntax.

## Build Notes

The [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory contains a Makefile file that builds the project files on the Linux platform. The C++ compiler the source files have been tested with is clang++. Navigate to the [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory and type "make [Enter]" to build a binary executable and create an input CSV data file. By default the build process creates a CSV data file that contains 100 data points. Type "make run [Enter]" to execute the program.

Here is a summary of the Makefile targets:

* make all [Enter] - Same as just "make [Enter]" - builds a binary executable and creates an input CSV data file containing 100 data points;
* make run [Enter] - Executes the program;
* make clean [Enter] - Deletes the binary executable and input CSV data file;
* make data100 [Enter] -  creates an input CSV data file containing 100 data points;
* make data1K [Enter] -   creates an input CSV data file containing 1,000 data points;
* make data10K [Enter] -  ... 10,000 data points;
* make data100K [Enter] - ... 100,000 data points;
* make data1M [Enter] -   ... 1,000,000 data points;
* make data10M [Enter] -  ... 10,000,000 data points.
