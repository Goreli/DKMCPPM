## Introduction

This directory contains source code written to address the 2D Convex Hull challenge published on the Wiki page of the Melbourne C++ Meetup Olympiad repo: https://github.com/melbourne-cpp/olympiad/wiki. A program has been written in C++ that solves the challenge. Also, a chart has been created using the output of the program that demonstrates a geometric relationship between the input and output datasets. The image below shows how the output of the program forms a 2D convex hull that encompasses the input dataset.

## Content Overview

The project source code consists of the following components located in the [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory:

* [ch2d_main.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch2d_main.cpp) - the entry module of the C++ program. The program parses the command line and expects an input file path to be specified as the first command line parameter. Example input files can be found in the [data](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/data) subdirectory. Also, additional input files can be created as described below;
* [ch_alg2d.hpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch_alg2d.hpp) and [ch_alg2d.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch_alg2d.cpp) - these modules define the logic of the solution at a high level;
* [ch_data_point2d.hpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch_data_point2d.hpp) and [ch_data_point2d.cpp](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/blob/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/ch_data_point2d.cpp) - an implementation of a 2D geometric point class that provides certain useful functionality utilised in the solution logic module.


The [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory also contains a Linux shell script called gen-inp-file2d.sh that generates input files containing random data for the solution. The x and y values generated by the script vary in the [-1.0, +1.0] range. The script depends on presence of the awk tool. Refer the content of Makefile to see example command line syntax. Be aware that the script uses a random number generator that creates a different data file every time it runs. Should there be a need to preserve an older data file it should be backed to preclude the destruction of the dataset.

## Build Notes

The project provides build artefacts for two platforms. There is a Makefile in the [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory that compiles the source code on the Linux platform using the clang++ compiler. There is also a Visual Studio 2019 project file in the [vs_projects](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull/vs_projects) subdirectory.

Navigate to the [2d_convex_hull](https://github.com/Goreli/DKMCPPM/tree/master/20191112/2d_convex_hull) directory and type "make [Enter]" to build a binary executable and create an input CSV data file on the Linux platform. By default the build process creates a CSV data file that contains 100 data points. Type "make run [Enter]" to execute the application. Here is a summary of the Linux Makefile targets:

* make all [Enter] - Same as just "make [Enter]" - builds a binary executable and creates an input CSV data file containing 100 data points;
* make run [Enter] - Executes the application;
* make clean [Enter] - Deletes the binary executable and input CSV data file;
* make release [Enter] - builds the application and copies it to the ../../elf/release directory;
* make data100 [Enter] -  creates an input CSV data file containing 100 data points;
* make data1K [Enter] -   creates an input CSV data file containing 1,000 data points;
* make data10K [Enter] -  ... 10,000 data points;
* make data100K [Enter] - ... 100,000 data points;
* make data1M [Enter] -   ... 1,000,000 data points;
* make data10M [Enter] -  ... 10,000,000 data points.

To build a Windows executable open the dkmccpm.sln solution file located in the root directory of the repository and navigate to this project in the Solution Explorer panel. The actual binaries are created in ../../x64. Here is the project configuration log:
1. Set the language standard to c++17;
2. Let the c++ compiler know the locations of include areas: ../..
3. Switch precompiled headers off.
